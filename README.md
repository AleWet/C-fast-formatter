# C-Fast Formatter

C-Fast Formatter is an open-source application designed to streamline data handling from C-Fast simulations. This tool simplifies the process of formatting and visualizing simulation data, making it easier for users to work with the results.

## Features

1. **Automatic Table Formatting**:
   - Accepts `.cvc` files generated by C-Fast as input.
   - Automatically formats the data into a table view that can be easily copied and pasted into other software.
   - To copy the entire table, press `CTRL + A` to select all, and then `CTRL + C` to copy.

2. **Quick Multi-Axis Graph Visualization**:
   - Visualize multiple variables from C-Fast simulations on a graph.
   - Gain insights into your simulation data quickly by focusing on the most relevant information.

## Technical Details

- Developed entirely using Qt.
- This application is intended solely for non-commercial use.
